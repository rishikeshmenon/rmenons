# 🎉 TYPESCRIPT PATH MAPPING FIXED - BUILD SUCCESS!

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

Your AI-powered Smart Home Platform build is now **100% successful** after fixing the TypeScript path mapping issue!

### 🔧 **Root Cause Identified**

The Vercel build was failing with:
```
./src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/card'
```

**Root Cause**: Missing `baseUrl` in `tsconfig.json` caused path mapping `@/*` to fail in production builds.

### 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

**Updated `tsconfig.json`**:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",  // ← ADDED THIS LINE
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
    // ... other options
  }
}
```

### ✅ **Build Status: SUCCESSFUL**

**Local Build**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL**
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 4.6s
✓ Collecting page data    
✓ Generating static pages (21/21)
